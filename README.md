# Installation

Download it [here](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/Sub-It/releases/download/v0.1/Sub.It.app.zip), unzip it and open it.
If a yellow package button is visible on the main screen, click on it and follow the guide (to install the dependencies).

# ToDo
These features will come:
- Ad blocker: Based on a friend of mine's script -> Filter all ads out of the downloaded subtitles.
- file association: right-click on your movie and select 'open with Sub It' will start the program and start downloading your subs.
- Menu bar status app: Drag your files the the icon in the menu bar and start downloading your subtitles.
- Cron job installation: see file association. Option to install a cron job to check your movie folder and download missing subtitles every time interval.
- Cute sounds.

# About

Sub It will download subtitles for all your movie files. It's a GUI round the popular Subliminal command-line program but with an easy to use interface and additional features.
It will save your settings dynamically or you can restore the default settings. The default settings will download the a single subtitle file in english. This was, in my opinion, the mostly used setting.


# Installation Guide

Sub It will check if the dependencies that it needs are installed. If not all dependencies are installed, there will be a package icon in the main window that you can click. This button will load a simple installation guide that will guide you through the installation of the missing dependencies. If a dependency is already installed on your Mac, than the guide will not show this to avoid over complicating it.
